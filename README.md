Dear ...,

Please accept this letter as notice of my resignation from my position as Software Engineer. My last day of employment will be at August 30, 2017.

The reason for my resignation is because of private issues. I've already reported this to team leader - Mr. Pham Thanh Lap had his approval for my resignation.

I will do all I can to ensure that my leaving is as smooth as possible. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here at Kyanon Digital.

Sincerely,
Brian.Vo
